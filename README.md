## 📌 What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology where data is stored in blocks and linked together in a chain.  
Each block contains:
- Transaction data
- Timestamp
- Previous block hash
- Its own hash

## 🔗 Why Is It Secure?
- Data cannot be changed without altering all following blocks.
- Network nodes must agree on data (consensus).
- No central server (decentralized).
